    "Sure, absolutely is it more details about the company or the ideas? â€“ first it is key to be positive, not reacting with conflict. Company: Brief description. Ideas: In terms of ideas, I wish I could send you something over, it would make my life so much easier. But there's a number of difficulties: 1. I don't know which ideas are suitable for you, I don't know your situation so it's a far better use of both our time to ascertain your situation and then give you something relevant. 2. Notwithstanding the fact that you probably wouldn't read the email. 3. Notwithstanding the fact that it probably wouldn't get through as it would be out of context and carrying about 50 different ideas in there. 4. But also there's a decision-making problem, as given 3 different relevant ideas based on your situation, you can make a decision. But if we send you over 50 different ideas you won't be able to; so, it's unlikely to lead anywhere anyway. But from my perspective it's a bit of give and take, if you're asking us to give away our secret formula then you need to do at least something to justify us doing that. So with that in mind, we've found out that the best way for you to learn about us and for us to take as little as possible from you in order to do that, the best way is to set aside half an hour, to do so in such a way that doesn't cost you anything, and during that meeting we can find out about you and furnish you with the ideas that are relevant so you can go off and find out more about them. So, if you think about it, apart from half an hour what have you got to lose?"
